# Customer-Segmentation-using-ML-algorithm

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their spending behavior and other features. The goal is to group customers into clusters to aid in targeted marketing strategies and personalized offerings.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Addressed missing values and duplicates.
Created additional features, such as credit utilization ratio and total transactions.
Identified and handled outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distributions using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
Analyzed relationships and correlations using a heatmap and pair plots.
Clustering Techniques:

Implemented K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and MiniSom (Self-Organizing Maps).
Evaluated clustering performance using silhouette scores.
Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualized clusters in 2D and 3D.
Technologies Used:

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and MiniSom.
Techniques: Scaling data with StandardScaler, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and clustering algorithms.
Project Workflow
Data Cleaning: Removed invalid entries, duplicated data, and anomalies.
Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features to enhance clustering performance.
Clustering Analysis: Applied various clustering models and evaluated their performance.
Visualization: Visualized clusters and their characteristics to interpret results.
