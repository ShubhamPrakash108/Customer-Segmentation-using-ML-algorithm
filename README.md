## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Addressed missing values and duplicates.  
  - Created additional features such as credit utilization ratio and total transactions.  
  - Identified and handled outliers.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Visualized data distributions using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.  
  - Analyzed relationships and correlations using a heatmap and pair plots.

- **Clustering Techniques:**  
  - Implemented **K-Means**, **Agglomerative Clustering**, and **MiniSom** (Self-Organizing Maps).  
  - Evaluated clustering performance using silhouette scores.  
  - Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualized clusters in 2D and 3D.

- **Technologies Used:**  
  - **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and MiniSom.  
  - **Techniques:** Scaling data with StandardScaler, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and clustering algorithms.
